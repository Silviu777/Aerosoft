# Aerosoft
Aerosoft is an airlines & flights management application which illustrates the basic CRUD functionalities on different entities, such as airlines, flights and pilots. Built with Node.js and Express.js for the backend component and Vue3 for the frontend, the application is accesible to two kinds of users: admin and normal user. The admin is able to perform the CRUD operations on the enumerated entities, while the normal user is only allowed to view the flights data along with the airlines information. This is accomplished through user authentication and authorization with JWT and security configuration for the specific URL routes which can be examined in backend.
